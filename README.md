Logic gates are the building blocks of a digital system, especially neural network. 

In short, they are the electronic circuits that help in addition, choice, negation, and combination to form complex circuits.

Using the logic gates, Neural Networks can learn on their own without you having to manually code the logic.

Most logic gates have two inputs and one output.

Each terminal has one of the two binary conditions, low (0) or high (1), represented by different voltage levels.

The logic state of a terminal changes based on how the circuit processes data.

Based on this logic, logic gates can be categorized into seven types:

AND

NAND

OR

NOR

NOT

XOR

XNOR

Implement Basic Logic Gates with Perceptron

The logic gates that can be implemented with Perceptron are discussed below.

AND

If the two inputs are TRUE (+1), the output of Perceptron is positive, which amounts to TRUE.

This is the desired behavior of an AND gate.

OR

If  either of the two inputs are TRUE (+1), the output of Perceptron is positive, which amounts to TRUE.

This is the desired behavior of an OR gate.

XOR

A XOR gate, also called as Exclusive OR gate, has two inputs and one output.
The gate returns a TRUE as the output if and ONLY if one of the input states is true.
